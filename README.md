## Making changes

Tried to make things non-brittle. If you want to reorder things, everything is basially handled by Program.js

Still need some bios. When you get em, put em in src/assets/Bios.json

Cast list can be edited in CastList.json. Used the order from the book.

If you want to edit your directors note, it's in DirectorsNote.js. Separate paragraphs into arrays.
